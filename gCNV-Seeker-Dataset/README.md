# gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV Dataset
A high quality resource for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of gCNV calling algorithms based on whole genome sequencing data.

## Description

**gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV Dataset** is a high-quality CNV calling dataset developed to serve as a benchmark for comparing CNV calling algorithms based on whole genome sequecning technology. The GoldenCNV dataset includes genomic regions (> 5000bp) with four major types of CNVs, (1) Heterozygous deletion (2)  Homozygous deletion (3) One-copy amplification, and (4) multi-copy amplification. After detection from CNV caller(s), the calling results in the dataset were validated using gCNV-Seeker and manucal curation. CNV-Gold provides a reliable and comprehensive resource for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of CNV calling algorithms, which can help to improve the detection of CNVs in large populations.
