# gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV

## Description

***gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV*** is a high-quality copy number variation (CNV) calling dataset developed as a benchmark for comparing CNV calling algorithms based on whole genome sequencing technology. The GoldenCNV dataset includes high-confidence genomic regions with four major types of CNVs: (1) heterozygous deletion, (2) homozygous deletion, (3) one-copy amplification, and (4) multi-copy amplification.

The calling results in the dataset were validated using gCNV-Seeker and manual curation after detection by CNV caller(s). In contrast to existing benchmark datasets (such as NA12878) that mainly focus on one sample from the HapMap project, GoldenCNV selects multiple high-confidence regions (>5000 bp) from over 3000 human genomes in the 1000 Genomes Project.

## Study Aim

The goal of GoldenCNV is to provide a reliable and comprehensive resource for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of CNV calling algorithms, which can help to improve the detection of CNVs in large populations.

## Release note

GoldenCNV is still in the development stage, and our official version will be online soon.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the whole Sherlock-lung team for their contributions to the development of GoldenCNV Dataset.
