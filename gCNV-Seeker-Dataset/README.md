 A comprehensive germline CNV detection and validation pipeline based on whole genome sequencing data



# Project Title

## Description

This project is currently ongoing and we are excited to announce that it will soon be available online as a easy-to-use tool for germline copy number variation detecion and validation. We have been working hard to develop and refine our packages, and we are confident that it will be a valuable resource for researchers in our field. 

The Github repository will include a comprehensive readme file that provides a detailed description of the project, its goals, and its functionality. We invite anyone who is interested in our work to check out the repository and explore the code, and we welcome feedback and contributions from the community.

Stay tuned for updates on the official release date!
