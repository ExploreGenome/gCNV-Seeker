# gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV Dataset
A high quality resource for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of gCNV calling algorithms based on whole genome sequencing data.

## Description

'''gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV Dataset''' is a high-quality CNV calling dataset developed to serve as a benchmark for comparing different CNV calling algorithms. The dataset includes genomic regions with different types of CNVs, such as deletions and amplifications, as well as regions with normal copy numbers. The CNV calls in the dataset were generated using a combination of high-throughput sequencing and microarray-based technologies, and were validated using multiple independent experimental methods. CNV-Gold provides a reliable and comprehensive resource for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of CNV calling algorithms, and for improving the detection of CNVs in human populations.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to get started with the project will be included in the readme file once the project is released.
