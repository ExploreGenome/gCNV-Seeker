# gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV
A high quality gCNV calling dataset for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of gCNV detection algorithms.

## Description

**gCNV-Seeker GoldenCNV** is a high-quality CNV calling dataset developed to serve as a benchmark for comparing different CNV calling algorithms based on whole genome sequecning technology. The GoldenCNV dataset includes high-confident genomic regions with four major types of CNVs, (1) Heterozygous deletion (2) Homozygous deletion (3) One-copy amplification, and (4) multi-copy amplification. 

After detection from CNV caller(s), the calling results in the dataset were validated using gCNV-Seeker and manucal curation. Unlike the existed benchmark dataset (NA12878) which mainly focus on one sample in the HapMap project, GoldenCNV select multiple high-confident regions (>5000 bp) from more than 3000 human genomes in the 1000 Genome Project. 

## Study Aim

The goal of GoldenCNV is to provide a reliable and comprehensive resource for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of CNV calling algorithms, which can help to improve the detection of CNVs in large populations.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the whole Sherlock-lung team for their contributions to the development of  GoldenCNV Dataset.
